								Vienna is one of the most important headquarters of International Organizations (IO) emerging as a hub for the promotion of peace, security, sustainable development, disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Further emphasis is given to fight against crime, drug abuse and terrorism.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Already during the Cold War Austria served as platform for international dialogue due to its geopolitical position and its neutral status. This position could be strengthened by the opening of the Vienna International Centre (VIC), also called UNO City, in 1979. Since then, Vienna is seat of the United Nations (UN) beside New York, Geneva and Nairobi.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								International institutions in Austria ‚Äì some 40 IOs, diplomatic representations, NGOs and Quasi-NGOs ‚Äì are an important economic factor, too. They employ more than 6000 collaborators out of which about a quarter are Austrians.
							</p>								
							<p>
								A robust, vibrant and functioning civil society is a measure of development. This is why cooperation with civil society organisations (CSOs) makes up a major component of sustainable development cooperation and development policy. Civil-society actors are engaged worldwide in helping to solve different sets of problems: In countries with weak public institutions, they often make a contribution to providing basic social services. They advance participation in social policymaking and discussion, undertake supervisory functions and demand respect for human rights and rule of law. With their know-how and experience, CSOs deploy donor resources where they are most needed.
							</p>								
							<p>
								The Austrian Development Agency cofinances projects and programmes by civil society organisations with various funding instruments. Applicant organisations must be located in Austria, based in civil society and cooperate with a partner organisation in developing countries. The projects and programmes are instigated by the CSOs themselves and are tailored to the specific needs of local target groups. The CSOs‚Äô own contributions depend on the funding instrument and country where the project/programme is carried out.
							</p>								
							<p>
								Funding priorities are direct poverty reduction, developing self-help capacities and strengthening local institutions. These include a diverse range of themes, primarily comprising rural development, food security, water supply & sanitation, education/training, human rights and peacekeeping, disaster prevention and environmental protection and climate change.
							</p>								
							<p>
								The Austrian federal states, as well as some municipalities, also act as donors of official development assistance.

								According to ISTAT (Italian Office of Statistics) there were 301,191 active nonprofit organizations in Italy.
							</p>							
							<p>
								Among them:<br>
								11,264 social cooperatives;<br>
								68,349 recognized associations;<br>
								201,004 non-recognized associations;<br>
								6,583 ecclesiastical bodies;<br>
								6,220 foundations;<br>
								14,354 other non-profit organizations.
							</p>							
							<p>
								The overall number of non-profit organizations increased in 2015 to 336,275. Italian law gives anyone the opportunity to form an association or a foundation. Article 18 of the Constitution protects this right.
							</p>								
							<p>
								Associations and foundations are the most common legal form of NGOs and are regulated by the Civil Code. In addition to the classical forms of non-profit organizations, Italian law distinguishes between recognized and unrecognized associations or committees.
							</p>								
							<p>
								Associations recognized as legal persons are those to which the competent authority (prefecture of the province where the entity is headquartered) has granted recognition, which is obtained by registration in the register of legal persons.
							</p>														
							<p>
								The committee is an organization based on an associative relation, with a closed structure, restricted to "promoters" only. All members are personally and jointly responsible for safe keeping the funds of the committee and their use (in absence of recognition), regardless of the type of activities carried out individually.
							</p>														
							<p>
								A committee finances its activities through the creation of a patrimony that does not derive from the contributions of its members, but from contributions from external subscribers to whom it is addressed with a specific program presented publicly.
							</p>														
							<p>
								The purpose of the committee consists of the promotion or implementation of a single initiative or specific event (also periodically repeated over time).

								‚Ä¢ do not have any state or local self-government bodies among the founders.
							</p>								
							<p>
								The Foundation holds a competition among NGOs in 13 areas:<br>
								‚Ä¢ Social services, social support and protection of citizens;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Support for youth projects;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Support of projects in the field of science, education, and enlightenment;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Support for projects in the field of culture and art;<br>
								‚Ä¢ The preservation of historical memory;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Protection of human and civil rights and freedoms, including the protection of prisoners' rights;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Protection of the environment and protection of animals;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Strengthening inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Development of public diplomacy and support of compatriots;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Development of civil society institutions;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Identification and support of young talents in the field of culture and art;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Protection of citizens ' health, promotion of a healthy lifestyle;<br>
								‚Ä¢ Support for family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood.<br>
							</p>								
							<p>
								For all 8 competitions held by the presidential grants Fund from April 2017 to June 2020, 14,977 projects totaling 30.9 billion rubles were supported.

								In Germany NGOs are called NROs (Nichtregierungsorganisationen). In part, the term NSO (nichtstaatliche Organisation) is also used.They are seen as "non-state" in the sense of "stateindependent", "government-independent". In addition to that the term is currently used by and for non-governmental organizations. They have a permanent, viable structure and their own seat. In Germany they can be organized locally, nationally or internationally.
							</p>							
							<p>
								Not all of the NGOs in Germany are only non-for-profit but most of them are. The most important issue is that they are non-for-profit in their core field of activities. And not in all cases they are coming with a voluntary approach. Most of them address issues in support of the public good. They are often associations, foundations or federations. Through their many years of experience, NGOs have often developed sustainable development-supporting structures and networks.
							</p>							
							<p>
								Therefore, there is an intensive exchange of opinions and experiences between states (L√§nder and Bund) and NGOs in Germany. Non-governmental organizations play a key role in raising the importance of development cooperation to the general public. In Germany, there are several thousand non-governmental development NGOs:<br>
								- funding associations;<br>
								- initiative groups;<br>
								- action alliances;<br>
								- working groups;<br>
								- solidarity groups;<br>
								- partnership institutions;<br>
								- foundations;<br>
								- development networks and many more.
							</p>								
							<p>
								In Germany NGOs depend heavily on volunteer work and donations. In 2014 the German Bundestag agreed on a Legal framework for the activity of Non-governmental organizations in Germany.
							</p>								
							<p>
								The strengths of NGOs can be seen in their close contacts to civil society in partner countries, even in countries in which government-level cooperation is difficult or impossible for political reasons. Thanks to their many years of involvement in partner countries they have often put in place structures and networks that foster development in the long term. For some years now, there has been an in-depth exchange of experience and views between the German government and NGOs for this reason. Along with the churches, political foundations and other private development bodies, NGOs are regularly involved in the elaboration of the BMZ's development-policy strategies for individual countries and regions.

								Official diplomatic relations between Greece and Russia were established on September 18, 1828.
							</p>							
							<p>
								Today, a large number of Russian compatriots live in Greece, and the Greek Diaspora in Russia is one of the most numerous.
							</p>							
							<p>
								The Greek Diaspora is the third largest in the Krasnodar region, so the plans of public organizations include projects that allow Greeks living in the Kuban to visit Greece, and Russian children living in Greece to visit Russia.
							</p>								
							<p>
								The social and cultural aspects of life in Greece and Russia have much in common. The countries are united by the same religion, similar alphabets, and love and respect for the culture and history of the two nations.
							</p>								
							<p>
								Russia and Greece also cooperate in the humanitarian sphere. There is a growing interest in learning Russian in Greece and Greek in Russia. In October 2018, at the Thracian University of Democritus (city of Komotini) was opened the Center of Russian language and culture Russian Fund "Russian world".
							</p>								
							<p>
								Greek resorts are also popular with Russian tourists: in 2017, the tourist flow from Russia to Greece amounted to 856 thousand people.
							</p>								
							<p>
								On may 22, a live broadcast took place between the project-manager of our organization and Anastasia, who is the development coordinator of the Russian Youth Council in Greece.
							</p>								
							<p>
								The speakers discussed the cultural features of the countries and the possibility of further cooperation.
